# Utilities

Useful utility functions without the bloat of Lodash. Built with performance in mind, many of these functions are trivial to write, but have been written with performance in mind. I find myself using these functions a lot.

## Installation

"Rolling release"

```
npm i Luke-zhang-04/utilities#dist
pnpm add Luke-zhang-04/utilities#dist
yarn add Luke-zhang-04/utilities#dist
```

To install a specific commit:

```
npm i Luke-zhang-04/utilities#<Commit hash>
pnpm add Luke-zhang-04/utilities#<Commit hash>
yarn add Luke-zhang-04/utilities#<Commit hash>
```

Make sure the commits are specifically from the dist branch.
